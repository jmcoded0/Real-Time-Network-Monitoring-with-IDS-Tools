# ðŸš€ Real-Time Network Monitoring with IDS Tools

This project is my deep dive into the fascinating, often chaotic, world of **network security and threat hunting**. After pouring my efforts into setting up my Splunk log analysis lab â€“ which was an absolute game-changer for understanding system events â€“ I hit a crucial realization: logs tell a story, but they don't always show the *entire* picture. To truly defend, you need to see the conversations happening *on the wires* themselves. That's why I embarked on this new journey: to build my very own Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) lab.

This isn't just about following a guide; it's about pushing my boundaries, understanding attacks from a network perspective, and getting hands-on with the tools that security professionals use every single day. I'm building an isolated ecosystem right inside VirtualBox, where I can safely let loose and observe both friendly and, more importantly, *unfriendly* network traffic.

## **My "Why": Expanding My Cybersecurity Vision**

My drive for this project comes from a desire to gain a truly holistic view of security. With Splunk, I learned to interpret system activities and correlate events. Now, I want to layer on the **network dimension**. I'm setting this lab up to:

* **Gain Unparalleled Network Visibility:** Forget just glancing at connection logs. I want to see the actual packets, understand the protocols, and track conversations in real-time. This is about knowing *who's talking to whom, how, and why*.
* **Master the Art of Intrusion Detection:** It's one thing to read about IDS; it's another to deploy a powerful tool like Suricata, write rules, and see it alert on a simulated attack you just launched. This is where I'm learning to identify the tell-tale signs of malicious activity on the network itself.
* **Generate Actionable Network Intelligence:** Beyond basic alerts, this lab focuses on configuring and using an IDS to generate high-fidelity information about network activity, which is invaluable for understanding traffic patterns and identifying threats.
* **Lay the Groundwork for a Comprehensive SIEM Picture:** The ultimate goal is to eventually funnel this new network data (Suricata alerts) into a centralized analysis platform like my existing Splunk Enterprise instance. This integration is key to creating a truly powerful Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, allowing me to correlate network anomalies with system events for a comprehensive view of my lab's security posture.

This project is truly valuable to me because it's forging a deeper understanding of cyber defense, from the raw packet level all the way up to centralized analysis. Itâ€™s practical, challenging, and directly applicable to real-world cybersecurity roles.

## **My Lab's Core Components: The Team Behind the Magic**

To bring this network monitoring dream to life, I'm relying on a carefully selected set of tools and virtual machines:

* **My Kali Linux VM (The Attacker & The Vigilant Eye):** This machine is pulling double duty. On one hand, it's my go-to for simulating various network attacks (like scans and exploit attempts) against my vulnerable target. On the other, and perhaps more crucially, it's transforming into my primary network monitoring station. Suricata will be running here, sniffing traffic and generating security insights. My Splunk Enterprise instance is also running on Kali, serving as a future central collection point for network intelligence.

* **Metasploitable2 VM (The Unsuspecting Target):** Every good security lab needs a willing victim! Metasploitable2 is a Linux virtual machine specifically designed with known, exploitable vulnerabilities. It's perfect for me to safely practice my attack techniques against, and more importantly, it generates a ton of "interesting" (read: suspicious) network traffic that my IDS and monitoring tools will pick up. It's a fantastic, controlled environment for learning.

* **VirtualBox (My Isolation Chamber):** My trusty virtualization hypervisor, VirtualBox, is essential. It allows me to create this entire isolated network lab, keeping my experimental attacks and vulnerable machines safely contained. This ensures I can learn and experiment without any risk to my main computer or home network.

* **Suricata (My Network Sentinel - IDS/IPS):** This powerful open-source tool is my front-line defense. I'll configure Suricata in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) mode. It's like having a highly trained guard dog constantly sniffing the network packets, looking for signatures of known attacks, policy violations, and suspicious behavior. When it finds something, it generates an alert â€“ a crucial piece of information that will eventually feed into my Splunk instance.
